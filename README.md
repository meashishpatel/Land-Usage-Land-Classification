# SAMAR â€“ SPACE BASED ANALYSIS FOR MONITORING OF AGRO-RESOURCES

## Project Overview

SAMAR is a project aimed at leveraging space-based technology for the monitoring and analysis of agricultural resources. It involves the use of satellite data and advanced analytics to provide insights into crop health, water management, and overall agricultural productivity.

## Developed By: 

- **Ashish Patel** (21CS002307) - Intern
## Supervisor
**Pradesh Jena** - Scientist-SD, Agriculture and Soil Division

## Project Goals

The primary goals of SAMAR include:
- Monitoring crop health and growth patterns through satellite imagery.
- Analyzing soil conditions and recommending appropriate agricultural practices.
- Providing actionable insights to farmers and agricultural authorities for better resource management.

## Technologies Used
